What is Git in actual ?

Git tracks our changes and GitHub helps us collaborate

Git is like your personal version notebook for code.
Tracks every change you make.
Lets you go back in time if something breaks.

GitHub is like an online library for your notebooks.
You can share, collaborate, and contribute to projects with others.

Example:

“Imagine you’re writing a group assignment. Git tracks all your edits, and GitHub lets your team see your work, suggest changes, and merge everything together.”

Collaboration without Git/GitHub is messy: overwriting each other’s files, losing work, or emailing files back and forth.
Git + GitHub = safe, organized, and collaborative coding.



Key Concepts -
Repository (Repo): A project folder tracked by Git
Commit: Save a snapshot of your work
Branch: Work on a separate “copy” of your project
Pull Request (PR): Propose changes to the main project
Merge: Combine changes from branches
